# PIC12f675PWM
Simple PWM Regulator.
I'm using it for solar charging unit.

14.5+ volt source to 13.8v/5v. It can adjust output voltage.
1kHz software PWM and 0~80% duty.

This is compiled by Mikro Pascal for PIC 6.4

LED Status.
0.5 sec - Normal. Good.
0.25 sec - Insuffient Input Power.
0.12 sec - Short on output.
