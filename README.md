# PIC12f675PWM
Simple PWM Regulator.
It's using on solar charger unit, and also using on other application.

14.5+ volt source to 13.8v. It can adjust output voltage.
1kHz software PWM and 0~96% duty.

Short protection on output, it is also by software checking.

This is compiled by Mikro Pascal for PIC 6.0
